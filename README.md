- Code experiments  
- Small projects  
- Course tracking  
- Ideas that might fail (and that’s part of the process)
## Python
I use it to focus on fundamentals and clarity rather than complexity:

- Core concepts (loops, functions, data structures)
- Writing simple, readable code
- Small scripts to automate boring tasks
- Using Python as a base for ML and backend work

## Neural Networks

This is the area I’m most serious about.

I’m learning neural networks from the ground up, focusing on understanding instead of shortcuts:

- How a single neuron works
- Forward pass, loss calculation, and backpropagation
- Why gradients behave the way they do
- What actually happens when a model “learns”

This is my first repository

Author :- Jay H.

## Personal Repository

I manage everything here on my own.
learning, notes, experiments, projects, and random ideas that turn into code.

There’s no fixed structure.
There’s no pressure to be perfect.

Just consistent progress, curiosity, and discipline.

###  What I manage here
- Daily learning notes
- Code experiments
- Small projects
- Course tracking
- Ideas that might fail (and that’s okay)

- Small projects  
- Course tracking

## Python
I use it to focus on fundamentals and clarity rather than complexity:

## Neural Networks

This is the area I’m most serious about.

I’m learning neural networks from the ground up, focusing on understanding instead of shortcuts:

- How a single neuron works
- Forward pass, loss calculation, and backpropagation
- Why gradients behave the way they do
- What actually happens when a model “learns”

This is my personal repository.
## About This Repo

I manage everything here on my own:  
learning, notes, experiments, small projects, and random ideas that slowly turn into code.

There’s no fixed structure.  
There’s no pressure to be perfect.

Just showing up, staying curious, and making consistent progress.

## What I work on here

- Daily learning notes  
- Code experiments  
- Small projects  
- Course tracking  
- Ideas that might fail (and that’s part of the process)

---

## Python

Python is my main language right now.

I use it to focus on fundamentals and clarity rather than complexity:

- Core concepts (loops, functions, data structures)
- Writing simple, readable code
- Small scripts to automate boring tasks
- Using Python as a base for ML and backend work

## Neural Networks

This is the area I’m most serious about.

I’m learning neural networks from the ground up, focusing on understanding instead of shortcuts:

- How a single neuron works
- Forward pass, loss calculation, and backpropagation
- Why gradients behave the way they do
- What actually happens when a model “learns”

## Machine Learning

ML here is practical, not just theoretical.

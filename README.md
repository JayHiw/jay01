This is my first repository

Author :- Jay H.

## Personal Repository

I manage everything here on my own.
learning, notes, experiments, projects, and random ideas that turn into code.

There’s no fixed structure.
There’s no pressure to be perfect.

Just consistent progress, curiosity, and discipline.

###  What I manage here
- Daily learning notes
- Code experiments
- Small projects
- Course tracking
- Ideas that might fail (and that’s okay)

Python

Python is my main language right now.

Here I work on:

Core language fundamentals (loops, functions, data structures)

Writing simple, readable code instead of over-engineering

Small scripts to automate boring tasks

Using Python as a base for ML and backend work
